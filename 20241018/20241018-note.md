- mongo no sql has one active record model cause ar only work with sql db

- summary
  - At MongoDB, they wanted to add a tighter integration between Rails and
    Mongoid (their ODM), so they created their our own CLI tool that extends
    the Rails CLI, adding the additional functionality they seeked. Former
    Rails core alumnus and Capistrano-creator Jamis Buck shows how they did it
    at #RailsWorld, and how you can do it yourself.
  
- rails prefer realtionship db

- rails new --database=mongodb app_name 
  - doesnt work. rails hardcode list of supported db
